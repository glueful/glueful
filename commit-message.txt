fix: resolve unit test failures in authentication modules

This commit fixes authentication unit test failures by:

- Fixed JWTServiceTest by aligning test methods with actual implementation
- Fixed AuthenticationManagerTest with proper mock implementations
- Fixed JwtAuthenticationProviderTest issues related to token sessions and admin checks
- Created a MockCache implementation for testing without actual cache servers
- Updated tests to properly mock CacheEngine for reliable test runs
- Expanded admin authorization tests to cover all code paths
- Added run-tests.sh script to use MAMP PHP directly for better environment control

Tests that now pass:
- JWTServiceTest
- AuthenticationManagerTest 
- JwtAuthenticationProviderTest

These fixes improve test reliability and maintainability by properly handling 
static properties and cache dependencies. The mock cache implementation 
enables tests to run without requiring actual Redis or cache servers.
