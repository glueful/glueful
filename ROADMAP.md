# Glueful Framework Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines Glueful's strategic path from its current state to a stable v1.0 release and beyond. The revised roadmap focuses on **realistic milestones** that prioritize core functionality and production readiness over advanced features.

## **Focused v1.0 Strategy**

**Pre-v1.0 Goals (v0.28.0 - v0.30.0):**
- **Production Readiness** (v0.28.0): Cloud deployment, zero-downtime updates, security audit
- **Developer Experience** (v0.29.0): Comprehensive documentation and tutorials  
- **Final Stability** (v0.30.0): Integration testing and release preparation

**v1.0.0 - Stable Release:**
- Production-ready framework with core REST API functionality
- Comprehensive authentication, permissions, and security
- Excellent developer experience with complete documentation
- API stability guarantees and backward compatibility

**Post-v1.0 Evolution:**
- **v1.1.0+**: Advanced scalability and enterprise features
- **v1.5.0**: Glueful Go implementation
- **v2.0+**: AI, IoT, and next-generation features

This approach ensures a **faster time-to-market** with a solid foundation, allowing advanced features to be built based on real-world usage and feedback.
