# Glueful Framework Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The Glueful community is dedicated to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

We encourage community members to:

**Be Respectful**: Treat all community members with dignity and courtesy. Value diverse perspectives and experiences, even when they differ from your own.

**Be Collaborative**: Work together constructively. Share knowledge freely and help others learn and grow within the Glueful ecosystem.

**Be Constructive**: Provide helpful feedback and criticism that focuses on ideas and code rather than individuals. Offer solutions and alternatives when pointing out problems.

**Be Patient**: Remember that people have different skill levels and backgrounds. Take time to explain concepts clearly and answer questions thoughtfully.

**Be Inclusive**: Use welcoming language and make an effort to include others in discussions. Avoid jargon or technical terms without explanation when communicating with newcomers.

### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:

**Harassment**: This includes offensive comments related to personal characteristics, unwelcome sexual attention, trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.

**Discrimination**: Treating people unfairly based on their identity, background, or personal characteristics.

**Disruptive Behavior**: Deliberately derailing conversations, spamming, or engaging in other activities that interfere with community participation.

**Privacy Violations**: Sharing private information about others without explicit permission, including personal contact information or private communications.

**Professional Misconduct**: Behavior that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting, including but not limited to making false claims about contributions or deliberately spreading misinformation.

## Community Guidelines

### Communication Standards

**Issue Reporting**: When reporting bugs or requesting features, provide clear, detailed information including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

**Code Reviews**: Focus feedback on the code itself rather than the author. Be specific about suggested improvements and explain the reasoning behind recommendations.

**Documentation**: Contribute to clear, accurate documentation that helps others understand and use Glueful effectively.

**Attribution**: Give proper credit for contributions, ideas, and solutions provided by community members.

### Technical Conduct

**Security**: Report security vulnerabilities responsibly through appropriate channels rather than public disclosure.

**Quality**: Strive to submit well-tested, documented code that follows established conventions and best practices.

**Licensing**: Respect intellectual property rights and ensure all contributions comply with the project's licensing terms.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers. All reports will be handled confidentially and reviewed promptly.

When reporting, please include:
- Description of the incident
- Date and time of occurrence
- Names of individuals involved (if known)
- Any relevant screenshots or documentation
- Impact of the behavior on you or the community

### Response Process

The maintainer team will:

1. **Acknowledge** receipt of the report within 48 hours
2. **Investigate** the matter thoroughly and confidentially
3. **Determine** appropriate response based on the severity and context
4. **Communicate** outcomes to relevant parties
5. **Monitor** for any retaliatory behavior

### Consequences

Depending on the severity of the violation, consequences may include:

**Warning**: A private written warning explaining the violation and expectations for future behavior.

**Temporary Suspension**: Temporary removal from community spaces, including repositories, forums, and communication channels.

**Permanent Ban**: Permanent exclusion from all community spaces and activities.

**Legal Action**: In cases involving illegal activity, appropriate authorities may be contacted.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Glueful community spaces, including:
- GitHub repositories and issue trackers
- Discussion forums and chat channels

- Social media accounts
- Community events and meetups
- Any other space where community members interact in relation to Glueful

The Code of Conduct also applies when community members are representing the project in public spaces.

## Leadership Responsibilities

Project maintainers and community leaders are responsible for:
- Clarifying standards of acceptable behavior
- Taking appropriate corrective action in response to violations
- Removing, editing, or rejecting contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct
- Temporarily or permanently banning contributors for inappropriate behavior

Leaders must also adhere to this Code of Conduct and may face consequences for violations.

## Attribution and Updates

This Code of Conduct is adapted from industry best practices and the Contributor Covenant. It will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure it continues to serve the community effectively.

Community members are encouraged to suggest improvements through the normal contribution process.
