Implementing the Extension System Recommendations for Glueful
Here's a practical roadmap for implementing each recommendation from the extension_system_recommendations.md file:

1. Package-Based Installation
To create a Composer-based extension system:

Create Extension Package Template:

Define a standard structure (e.g., src, config, /migrations)
Create a base composer.json template with required Glueful dependencies
Include autoloading configuration that follows PSR-4 standards
Set Up a Package Repository:

Use Packagist.org for public extensions or set up a private Composer repository
Configure Satis or Packagist Private for hosting private extensions
Create Installation Hooks:

Develop a Composer plugin that runs post-install/update actions
Extend the ExtensionsManager to detect Composer-installed extensions
Modify extensions.php to automatically include Composer packages in the extensions directory
Update Documentation:

Create a guide for extension developers on publishing packages
Update installation instructions with Composer commands
2. Enhanced Manual Installation
To improve the manual installation process:

CLI Improvements:

Add a php glueful extensions:install command that creates a scaffold
Enhance the enable command to validate extensions before activation
Add feedback during installation about potential conflicts
Directory Structure Enforcement:

Create validation for required files in extensions
Add linting checks to ensure extensions follow standards
Dependency Resolution:

Build a dependency checker for manually installed extensions
Display warnings if dependencies aren't met

3. Extension Marketplace in Admin UI
To build an extension marketplace:

API Development:

Create endpoints for fetching extension catalog
Develop authentication for protected extensions
Build download/installation API handlers
Frontend Interface:

Add a marketplace page to the admin UI (/admin/src/pages/marketplace.vue)
Create components for extension cards, details, and installation flow
Implement search and filtering by category/feature
Extension Metadata Standard:

Enhance the getMetadata() method to include more details:
Screenshots URLs
Documentation links
Feature lists
Compatibility requirements
Extension Repository:

Develop a central repository service for extensions
Create an extension submission and review process
Implement version tracking and updates
4. Post-Installation Setup
To improve post-installation configuration:

Configuration Wizard:

Develop a standard interface for extensions to define setup steps
Create a wizard component in the admin UI
Store extension-specific configurations in dedicated files
Database Migration Support:

Add an extension migration path in the migration manager
Support versioned migrations for extensions
Create rollback functionality for uninstallation
Extension Documentation Generator:

Add functionality to extract documentation from extension code
Create a documentation viewer in the admin UI
Support Markdown and interactive examples

5. Enhance Enable/Disable Functionality
To improve the existing enable/disable system:

Performance Monitoring:

Add metrics collection on extension resource usage
Create a dashboard showing extension impact on system performance
Implement suggestions for extensions to disable based on usage patterns
Dependency Management:

Build a dependency graph for extensions
Prevent disabling extensions that others depend on
Offer to disable dependent extensions when disabling a core extension
Environment Configuration:

Add environment-specific extension configurations
Allow different enabled/disabled states per environment
Support feature flags within extensions
Health Checks:

Implement periodic health checks for enabled extensions
Create an extension diagnostics page in the admin UI
Add self-healing capabilities for common issues

Implementation Timeline
A phased approach would work best:

Phase 1 (1-2 months):

Enhance the existing enable/disable functionality
Improve manual installation with better CLI tools
Create the extension metadata standard
Phase 2 (2-3 months):

Implement the Composer package system
Develop basic marketplace functionality
Add configuration wizard framework
Phase 3 (3+ months):

Complete the marketplace with ratings and reviews
Implement advanced health monitoring
Add dependency resolution and environment configurations
By following this roadmap, you can incrementally enhance Glueful's extension system while maintaining compatibility with existing extensions.

Existing extensions should gradually adopt the new metadata standard by:

1. First adding the required fields if they're missing
2. Then adding the most important optional fields:
   - `homepage` and `documentation`
   - `screenshots`
   - `features`
   - `settings`
3. Finally adding the remaining fields over time

The system should handle gracefully both the old minimal metadata format and this new comprehensive format.
