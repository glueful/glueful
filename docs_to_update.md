 Based on my thorough review of the codebase versus the existing documentation, here are the markdown documentation files that need updating, are redundant, or are
   missing entirely:

  Files That Need Updating

  1. docs/SETUP.md - MAJOR UPDATE NEEDED

  - Issues: Very basic, missing many features implemented in codebase
  - Missing: Archive system setup, notification system, queue configuration, advanced cache setup, extension installation, CLI command references
  - Outdated: Basic database setup only, missing production readiness steps

  2. docs/EXTENSION_SYSTEM_V2.md - MODERATE UPDATE NEEDED

  - Issues: Good overall but missing some newer extension features
  - Missing: Social login providers (Apple, Facebook, GitHub, Google), BeanstalkdQueue integration details, advanced RBAC features
  - Update needed: Extension dependency management, new template system

  3. docs/EVENTS.md - MAJOR UPDATE NEEDED

  - Issues: Framework vs application boundaries need clarification
  - Missing: Integration patterns with logging system, session analytics events, new security events, proper event listener examples
  - Outdated: Some event class references and usage patterns

  4. docs/SECURITY.md - MODERATE UPDATE NEEDED

  - Issues: Missing vulnerability scanner documentation, session analytics security features
  - Missing: Vulnerability scanning configuration, API metrics security, advanced rate limiting features

  5. docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md - MINOR UPDATE NEEDED

  - Issues: Missing some newer database optimization features
  - Missing: Session analytics optimization, API metrics system performance, response caching strategies

  Files That Are Redundant

  1. docs/features/EMAIL_NOTIFICATION.md - REDUNDANT

  - Reason: Content should be merged into main notifications documentation
  - Action: Merge into notifications guide and remove

  2. docs/MIDDLEWARE.md - POTENTIALLY REDUNDANT

  - Reason: Basic middleware info that could be integrated into main guides
  - Action: Consider merging into security or request handling documentation

  Critical Missing Documentation Files

  1. docs/LOGGING_SYSTEM.md - CRITICALLY MISSING

  - Need: Comprehensive logging system guide covering LogManager, channels, rotation, performance logging, database logging
  - Content: Configuration, usage patterns, troubleshooting, best practices

  2. docs/SESSION_ANALYTICS.md - MISSING

  - Need: Session analytics and metrics system documentation
  - Content: Configuration, usage, analytics dashboard, security monitoring

  3. docs/API_METRICS.md - MISSING

  - Need: API metrics and monitoring system guide
  - Content: Metrics collection, dashboard integration, alerting, performance monitoring

  4. docs/CACHING_SYSTEM.md - MISSING

  - Need: Comprehensive caching guide beyond performance optimization
  - Content: Response caching, cache strategies, CDN integration, distributed caching

  5. docs/DATABASE_ADVANCED.md - MISSING

  - Need: Advanced database features documentation
  - Content: Connection pooling, query optimization, profiling, schema management

  6. docs/QUEUE_SYSTEM.md - MISSING

  - Need: Complete queue system documentation
  - Content: Configuration, workers, auto-scaling, monitoring, troubleshooting

  7. docs/CONSOLE_COMMANDS.md - MISSING

  - Need: Complete CLI commands reference
  - Content: All available commands, usage examples, automation scripts

  8. docs/AUTHENTICATION_PROVIDERS.md - MISSING

  - Need: Authentication providers guide
  - Content: LDAP, SAML, API key authentication, session management

  9. docs/VULNERABILITY_SCANNING.md - MISSING

  - Need: Security scanning system documentation
  - Content: Configuration, scan types, reporting, automation

  10. docs/LOCK_SYSTEM.md - UPDATE NEEDED

  - Current: Basic documentation exists but missing advanced features
  - Need: Enhanced with new features, patterns, troubleshooting

  Files With Minor Issues

  1. docs/MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md - GOOD (Minor updates needed)

  - Action: Add integration examples with other systems

  2. docs/DEPLOYMENT.md - GOOD (Minor updates needed)

  - Action: Add service-specific deployment notes

  3. docs/logging/FRAMEWORK_VS_APPLICATION_LOGGING.md - GOOD

  - Action: Integrate better with main logging documentation

  Recommendations by Priority

  HIGH PRIORITY (Critical Missing Documentation)

  1. Create LOGGING_SYSTEM.md
  2. Create SESSION_ANALYTICS.md
  3. Create API_METRICS.md
  4. Update SETUP.md completely
  5. Create CONSOLE_COMMANDS.md

  MEDIUM PRIORITY

  1. Create CACHING_SYSTEM.md
  2. Create DATABASE_ADVANCED.md
  3. Create QUEUE_SYSTEM.md
  4. Update EVENTS.md
  5. Create AUTHENTICATION_PROVIDERS.md

  LOW PRIORITY

  1. Create VULNERABILITY_SCANNING.md
  2. Update EXTENSION_SYSTEM_V2.md
  3. Update SECURITY.md
  4. Remove redundant files and merge content

  The documentation is significantly behind the actual implementation, with many enterprise-grade features completely undocumented.
