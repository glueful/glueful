{{user_name|Guest}}        // Default values
{{#if premium}}...{{/if}}  // Conditional blocks
```

#### Configuration Migration
Update your configuration to use the new provider-specific format:

```env
# Old format (still works)
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587

# New enhanced format
EMAIL_PROVIDER=gmail
EMAIL_RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR=1000
